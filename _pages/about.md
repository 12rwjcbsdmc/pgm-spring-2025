Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information.
The probabilistic graphical models framework provides an unified view for this wide range of problems, enables efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets.
This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models.

The class will cover the following aspects: the core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models; modern topics such as deep generative models and reinforcement learning.
Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong mathematical background to catch up and fully participate.

### Textbooks

The required textbook for this class is (note that the material of the class goes beyond this book):
- Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman, [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250711756&sr=8-1){:target="\_blank"}.

We will also be using excerpts from the following work, which you do not need to purchase:
- Michael I. Jordan, **An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models**, in preparation.<br/>
Copies of certain chapters will be made available to students taking the class.

Optional:
- Kevin Murphy, **Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective**.
