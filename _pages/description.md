Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information.
The probabilistic graphical models framework provides an unified view for this wide range of problems, enabling efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets.
This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models.

The class will cover three aspects: the core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models.
Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong mathematical background to catch up and fully participate.

It is expected that after taking this class, students will have obtained sufficient working knowledge of multi-variate probabilistic modeling and inference for practical applications, should be able to formulate and solve a wide range of problems in their own domain using graphical models, and can advance into more specialized technical literature by themselves.

In order to take this class, students are required to have successfully completed Machine Learning 10-701/15-781, or an equivalent class.

### textbooks

The required textbook for this class is (note that the material of the class goes beyond this book):
- Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman, [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250711756&sr=8-1).

We will also be using excerpts from the following work, which you do not need to purchase:
- Michael I. Jordan, **An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models**, in preparation. Copies of certain chapters will be made available.

Optional:
- Kevin Murphy, **Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective**.

### grading

The class requirements include brief reading summaries, scribe notes for 1 lecture, 4 problem sets, and a project.
This is a PhD level course, and by the end of this class you should have a good understanding of the basic methodologies in probabilistic graphical models, and be able to use them to solve real problems of modest complexity.
The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Reading Summaries (10%)
- Scribe Duties (10%)
- Homework Assignments (40%)
- Final Project (40%)

Note that this class does not have any tests or exams.

<!-- ### reading summaries

**The required readings for this class are compulsory.**
At the beginning of each lecture, students are to submit a *half-page summary* of the readings for that lecture.
Submitting a hard copy is a requirement and must be turned in on time *individually* (i.e. before the start of each class) in order to receive the credit.

You have a total of **5 grace days** on which you can submit the summaries after the start of class or via email to [10708-instructor@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:10708-instructor@cs.cmu.edu) with no penalty.

The summaries must be written at a high level and should focus on the main points of the assigned reading.
As long as the summary is reasonable, full credit will be given. -->

### scribe duties

Each student is required to scribe for a small number of lectures (most likely just 1).
Most lectures will have at least 2 students acting as scribes, and they should work as a team.
During your assigned lectures, you are to take detailed notes in collaboration with your fellow scribes.
After the lecture, the scribe team is to convert their notes into a written format (LaTeX).
The notes must be detailed and thorough, and must be submitted through a Pull Request on GitHub within 1 week after the lecture.
TAs will audit and review the submitted notes, request changes if necessary, and will eventually approve the notes and add them to the class page.

As long as your scribe notes are of sufficient standard, you will be awarded full credit for scribe duties.
If your notes have errors or are otherwise not up to standard, we will inform you and give you a chance to correct them.
You will receive zero credit if you fail to submit your notes.

### homework assignments

There will be 4 homework assignments over the course of the semester.
These assignments may contain material that has been covered by published papers and webpages.
It is a graduate class and we expect students to solve the problems themselves rather than search for answers.

We strongly recommend that you typeset your homework using appropriate software such as $$\LaTeX.$$
If you are writing please make sure your homework is cleanly written up and legible.
**The TAs will not invest undue effort to decrypt bad handwriting.**

### collaboration policy

**Homework assignments must be done individually:** each student must hand in their own answers.
However, it is acceptable to collaborate when figuring out answers and to help each other solve the problems.
We will be assuming that, as participants in a graduate course, you will be taking the responsibility to make sure you personally understand the solution arising from such collaboration.
You also must indicate on each homework with whom you have collaborated.


### final project

The class project will be carried out in groups of 2 or 3 people, and has four main parts: a proposal, a midway report, a final report, and a poster/oral presentation.
The project is an integral part of this class, and is designed to be as similar as possible to researching and writing a conference-style paper.
Please see the project page for more information about the final project.


### late policy

You will be allowed 2 total homework late days without penalty for the entire semester.
You may be late by 1 day on two different homework assignments or late by 2 days on one homework.
Once those days are used, you will be penalized according to the following policy:

- Homework is worth full credit at the due time on the due date.
- It is worth half credit for the next 48 hours.
- It is worth zero credit after that.

You must turn in at least 3 of the 4 assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.
**Please upload your late submissions to Gradescope.**

### regrade policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework, please submit a regrading request on Gradescope and we will consider your request.
Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your grade to go either up or down.

### auditing

To satisfy the auditing requirement, you must do *one* of the following:

1. **Submit three homeworks** and receive at least 75% of the points on each one.
2. **Do a class project** which must address a topic related to machine learning and must be something that you have started while taking this class (i.e. it can't be your previous work).
You will need to submit a project proposal with everyone else, and present the project with everyone.
However, you don't need to submit a milestone or final paper.
You must get at least 80% on the final presentation part of the project.

*If you plan to audit the class, please notify instructors that you are auditing and specify which requirement you plan to fulfill.*
