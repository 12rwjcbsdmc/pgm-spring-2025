## Project

- **Proposal** (5%): Due Feb 21, 2025. Must outline the group members, problem statement, motivation, dataset(s).
- **Midway Report** (5%): Due Apr 11, 2025. Build on the proposal to have some preliminary dataset exploration and revised methods.
- **Presentation** (5%): During the last week of class, students will present their findings in a concise and engaging format.
- **Report** (15%): Due May 5, 2025. The report should detail the problem, methods, results, and conclusions.
- **Collaboration:** Teams of up to three students are allowed. Contributions of each individual must be clearly delineated in the report.

## Extra Credit: Lecture Notes

- **Opportunity:** Students can sign up to write lecture notes for each class session. If the notes meet quality standards, students will receive up to 3% extra credit added to their final grade.
  - [Sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Mj0MwkSxidVe-HfnMZyUIk4N8cwMeuGzEYTrgDjKqk/edit?gid=0)
  - You are expected to work together with the other scribe to generate 1 note document for the lecture.
  - Accepted notes will be hosted on our course webpage (optionally with your name attached, your choice).
- **Submission:** Lecture notes must be submitted within one week of the session.
  - Submit on the GitHub [for the course webpage](https://github.com/LengerichLab/pgm-spring-2025/blob/master/_posts/README.md).
- Template is available [on the webpage](https://lengerichlab.github.io/pgm-spring-2025/notes/lecture-notes-template/).

## Attendance / Participation

- Attendance and participation are expected, though they are not part of the formal grade calculation.
- Contact the instructor in advance of extended absences.

## Academic Integrity

- By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University of Wisconsin–Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration and helping others commit these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action. Examples of disciplinary sanctions include, but are not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension or expulsion.

## Mental Health & Wellbeing

- Students often experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and personal well-being. These may include mental health concerns, substance misuse, sexual or relationship violence, family circumstances, campus climate, financial matters, among others.
- UW–Madison students are encouraged to learn about and utilize the university’s mental health services and/or other resources as needed. Students can visit uhs.wisc.edu or call University Health Services at (608) 265-5600 to learn more.

## Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)

**What is a Graphical Model?**

A graphical model is a technique for representing a probability distribution to make inferences in situations involving uncertainty, which is essential for tasks like speech recognition and computer vision. Typically, we have a dataset consisting of samples:
$D = \{X_{1}^{(i)},X_{2}^{(i)},...,X_{m}^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^N$. The relationships between the elements in each $X$ can be represented by a graph $G$. From this, we derive the model $M_G$.
